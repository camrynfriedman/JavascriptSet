<div>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>In the game of Set, 12 cards are dealt face up on the table.</p>
    <p>Each card has four attributes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shape: Squiggle, Oval, Diamond</li>
        <li>Color: Red, Purple, Green</li>
        <li>Number: 1, 2, 3</li>
        <li>Shading: Filled, Striped, Open</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The object of the game is to get a Set. In this case, a Set consists of 3 cards where each of the card's features are the SAME on each card, or DIFFERENT on each card.</p>
    <p>When you identify a correct set, the cards will be removed from the table and three new ones will appear.</p>
    <p>There's a chance that you are unable to identify any sets on the table. In this case, you can choose to add three new cards to the table.</p>

    <!--Provide an example of a Set once we figure out how to display them on the screen (CSS?)-->

        <!--The table should below should OBVIOUSLY change, it is just a template for now. If we include an id for each element and reference the ID in the Javascript file, it will work the way we want it to. Just an idea, probably needs to change though-->

                <td>Card 1</td> <!--Use this ID tag to call a Javascript function (probably onclick) kinda like how we did on the midterm?-->
