        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>In the game of Set, 12 cards are dealt face up on the table.</p>
        <p>Each card has four attributes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shape: Squiggle, Oval, Diamond</li>
            <li>Color: Red, Purple, Green</li>
            <li>Number: 1, 2, 3</li>
            <li>Shading: Filled, Striped, Open</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The object of the game is to get a Set. In this case, a Set consists of 3 cards where each of the card's features are the SAME on each card, or DIFFERENT on each card.</p>
        <p>When you identify a correct set, the cards will be removed from the table and three new ones will appear.</p>
        <p>There's a chance that you are unable to identify any sets on the table. In this case, you can choose to add three new cards to the table.</p>
